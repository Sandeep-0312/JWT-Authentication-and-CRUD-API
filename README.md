This repository contains a Flask-based API that uses JWT for authentication and integrates with a MongoDB database to perform CRUD operations.

{This code in sepreate won't make any sense it's a part of my project that,I am working on for a while}

Features
JWT Authentication: Secure your API endpoints with JSON Web Tokens.
MongoDB Integration: Connect and interact with a MongoDB database for data storage.
CRUD Operations: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the database.
How to Use
Clone the Repository: Download the code to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
cd your_repository
Install Dependencies: Use pip to install the necessary packages.

pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Up MongoDB: Ensure MongoDB is installed and running. Modify the MongoDB connection string in the code if necessary.

mongo_uri = "mongodb://localhost:27017" # Update if needed
db_name = "test" # Your database name
collection_name = "test" # Your collection name
Run the Application: Start the Flask server.

python app.py
